## About Me

I graduated with a Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Computer Science and am currently pursuing a Master‚Äôs Degree in Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sonora, Hermosillo campus.

I am a professional with extensive knowledge in various programming areas, including languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, and C++. I stand out for my ability to quickly learn new concepts and technologies, which allows me to easily adapt to changing environments and innovative projects.

My self-taught ability has allowed me to acquire advanced skills autonomously, complementing my academic and professional training. In addition, I have a strong interest in sharing my knowledge with others, either through mentoring, workshops, or team collaborations, fostering an environment of continuous learning and collective growth.
